        Devangi madam, I am Sagar Patil. Hearty Congratulations on completion of your services of Sound & Speech for 19years and Josh Foundation for 13years..that makes me so proud of you! One of my close friends, Akshay Deshmukh, introduced me to Devangi madam and Josh foundation a decade ago. Then, Devangi madam identified my limitations of speech and hearing capabilities and helped me to improve them by using high quality digital hearing aids which gave great results. It helped me to boost my confidence, passion, courge, activities and many more things. So, I am really very grateful to her. Now, I'm enjoying my life just like normal people. Josh Foundation is a great trustee platform for hearing handicapped students and people which supports them and helps them to boost their capabilities in life. They also organise different cultural, functions, educational programs, some shows and also publish booklets of successful hearing handicapped students/people articles every year. Thus, it helps us to unite the hearing handicapped people & introduce ourselves to each other. Wishing Devangi madam and Josh Foundation all the best for their future endeavours and their journey ahead. Thank you so much Devangi madam & Josh foundation. I am very lucky to be a part of Josh Foundation.
